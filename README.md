lets say i just finished all of waiv code

now what?

i commit, test, push

then i deploy with npm deploy

i should get a url in gh pages.

at this point, waiv is finished on code-side in gh

i go to namecheap and add cname records (like 5 files/records or something idk)

i get white page json line 1 error

i go to code, fix json line 1, commit, push


waivmagazine.com directs to react template??

god i can only hope. i hate dev op crap

worst part of coding.
